\b0 Found issue with where the files were printing. In Mac the file locations are not automatically relative as in PC. So the filenames have to have the files explicitly stated in the filename ie 
\f1\fs22 \cf2 \CocoaLigature0 "/Users/kevin/Desktop/School/Spring 2013/Cole Research/orbit.dat"\cf0 ,\cf2 "w" 
\f0\fs24 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1 I've added them explicitly here however I'm trying to find a way to make them automatic. I tried getcwd() as per link one but as link one also suggests this does gets whatever the directory the executable is running in not where the .cpp file is. I'm going to try a python integrated way of getting it next. I also tried the second link before trying python\
